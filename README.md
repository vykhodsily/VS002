## Descriptoin

The second EP on VS Recordings has touched our digital surface. This time it’s been provided by 2 Serbian producers well-known worldwide and whose previous releases on other labels made our jaws drop. Talking about GhoulCut & AlgOrh1tm. The duo is taking you inside the dream-modulating kinda machine from the distant future, where one can program his dreams of his own, getting them physical, touching them, making love to them and what not. Get in full contact with your weirdest dreams. Just press «play».
